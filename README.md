# neural_networks_for_machine_learning_coursera
Hinton's Coursera course on neural networks (Equivalent to U of Toronto course: CSC321 Intro to Neural Networks). 
Taken in winter, 2017.

After taking the Machine Learning course by Andrew on Coursera. I found myself fansinated by the subjects. 
So I have decided to take this course during the winter break to have a better understanding on related fields.

This repository only includes the four programming assignments. The codes of RBMs can pass the assignement, but cannot get full score (definitely need to work on that a little more). :P
